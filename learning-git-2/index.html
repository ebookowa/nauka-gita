		<h1>Unforgiven</h1>
		<h4><em>by Metallica</em></h4>
	</header>
	<p>New blood joins this earth<br>
		And quickly he's subdued<br>
		Through constant pain disgrace<br>
		The young boy learns their rules<br>
		With time the child draws in<br>
		This whipping boy done wrong<br>
		Deprived of all his thoughts<br>
		The young man struggles on and on he's known<br>
		A vow unto his own<br>
		That never from this day<br>
		His will they'll take away</p>
		<p><em>What I've felt<br>
		What I've known<br>
		Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
		Never be<br>
		Never see<br>
		Won't see what might have been<br>
		What I've felt<br>
		What I've known<br>
		Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
		Never free<br>
		Never me<br>
		So I dub thee <strong>unforgiven</strong</em></p>
		<p>They dedicate their lives<br>
		To running all of his<br>
		He tries to please them all<br>
		This bitter man he is<br>
		Throughout his life the same<br>
		He's battled constantly<br>
		This fight he cannot win<br>
		A tired man they see no longer cares<br>
		The old manâ€¦
